# Final_Project-

Outline: 

1. Clean/Transform Dataset 
- is postal code the code for the hospital or where the patient is coming from? 
2. 


- does hospital location influence wait time for patients
- does agency influence wait time for patients
- does day of week/date effect wait time for patients
- could have model show what impression category shows up most during certain times of day or day of week
- can model predict which hospitals are busier on certain days of week / time
- could have user interface be used to show prediction of wait times by day of week vs actual date 
- features: 'impression', , 'day of week', 'ambulance code/hospital'
- target: 'wait time' 


* Charts: 
- patients being admitted each month per year 
- number of impression vs month (per year)
- wait times vs impression types 
- zip code vs number of patients
